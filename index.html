<p> Greetings, I'm Pawe≈Ç and I come from Poland. My hobbies include chess, learning languages, brazilian jiu jitsu, and coding. I have aspirations to one day make an impact on the tech world, and in order to do that, I am fully diving into coding for the forseeable future. My biggest hope is to create a fully integrated virtual reality environment where the individual can interact with an AI. This will serve as an escape for many people from the real world, and allow them to immerse themselves into a beautiful new world to explore. This environment will potentially be represented as a large manor, with a library, movie theatre, kitchen, and shopping center. The real world application of this, is to either make it a subscription service, in which users will pay monthly to use books, or watch movies inside of their environment, or pay a small price per item.</p>
<br>
<p> The kitchen will allow users to order real life food straight from their virtual environment. Once the food is nearly there, a notification will show up telling the user that it is time to leave their immersion in order to get their food.The library could potentially serve as a quaint place to do your work when no alternative can be found in the real world (house full of people, and nowhere to study) by utilising noise cancelling technology and combining it will the integrated environment. Of course, while the user is in the environment, the AI will track their data and record it for the sake of pattern learning, and improving it's own algorithms. The AI will serve as a useful tool for the users as well, allowing them to ask it to pull up a specific book movie or file, change location quickly, or have a conversation. Furthermore, this AI will improve over time to allow for more features that cannot be disclosed for the sake of maintaining intellectual integrity. Finally, it would be cool to add features to the vitual environment, such as dimming of lights, audio level, music, and customisable walls and furniture.</p>
